        "1. What is NumPy, and why is it widely used in Python?\n",
        "- NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library used for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on them efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.How does broadcasting work in NumPy?\n",
        "- How Does Broadcasting Work in NumPy?\n",
        "Broadcasting in NumPy allows element-wise operations on arrays of different shapes without the need for explicit looping. NumPy automatically expands smaller arrays to match the dimensions of larger ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is a Pandas DataFrame?\n",
        "-A Pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional, tabular data structure in Python, similar to an Excel spreadsheet or an SQL table. It consists of rows and columns, where:\n",
        "\n",
        "Rows → Represent individual data points (indexed).\n",
        "\n",
        "Columns → Represent different attributes (labeled with column names).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Explain the use of the groupby() method in Pandas?\n",
        "- The groupby() method in Pandas is used to split a dataset into groups based on one or more columns and then apply aggregate functions (like sum, mean, count, etc.) to those groups. It works similarly to SQL’s GROUP BY statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  Why is Seaborn preferred for statistical visualizations?\n",
        "- Seaborn is preferred for statistical visualizations because it provides high-level, well-styled, and insightful visual representations of data. It is built on Matplotlib but offers simpler syntax and better default aesthetics, making it ideal for exploratory data analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What are the differences between NumPy arrays and Python lists?\n",
        "-NumPy arrays (numpy.ndarray) and Python lists (list) are both used to store collections of data, but they differ significantly in terms of performance, functionality, and memory efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is a heatmap, and when should it be used?\n",
        "-A heatmap is a data visualization technique that represents numerical data using color gradients. It is typically used to show the intensity, correlation, or distribution of data across a matrix or spatial representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What does the term “vectorized operation” mean in NumPy?\n",
        "- A vectorized operation in NumPy refers to the process of applying mathematical or logical operations on entire arrays without using explicit loops. These operations are executed at a low level in highly optimized C code, making them much faster than standard Python loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. How does Matplotlib differ from Plotly?\n",
        "- Matplotlib and Plotly are both popular Python libraries for data visualization, but they differ in terms of functionality, interactivity, and use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the significance of hierarchical indexing in Pandas?\n",
        "- Hierarchical Indexing (or MultiIndexing) in Pandas allows multiple levels of indexing within a DataFrame or Series. This is useful for working with multi-dimensional data in a tabular format, enabling more efficient data organization, selection, and analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the role of Seaborn’s pairplot() function?\n",
        "-The pairplot() function in Seaborn is used to create a scatterplot matrix, which helps visualize the relationships between multiple numerical variables in a dataset. It is especially useful for exploratory data analysis (EDA) to detect patterns, correlations, and outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  What is the purpose of the describe() function in Pandas?\n",
        "- The describe() function in Pandas provides summary statistics for numerical and categorical columns in a DataFrame. It helps in exploratory data analysis (EDA) by giving key insights such as count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and percentiles for numerical data, and count, unique values, most common value, and frequency for categorical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is handling missing data important in Pandas?\n",
        "- Handling missing data is crucial in Pandas because missing values can lead to incorrect analysis, biased insights, and errors in machine learning models. Proper handling ensures data integrity, accuracy, and completeness for better decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What are the benefits of using Plotly for data visualization?\n",
        "- Plotly is a powerful Python library for creating interactive, high-quality, and web-based visualizations. It is widely used for data analysis, dashboards, and real-time analytics.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does NumPy handle multidimensional arrays?\n",
        "- NumPy provides a powerful ndarray (N-dimensional array) object that allows efficient storage, manipulation, and operations on multidimensional arrays. It is optimized for performance, making it ideal for scientific computing and machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the role of Bokeh in data visualization?\n",
        "- Bokeh is a Python library designed for creating interactive, web-ready visualizations that can handle large datasets efficiently. It allows users to build dynamic, scalable, and high-performance visualizations for dashboards, reports, and analytics applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Explain the difference between apply() and map() in Pandas?\n",
        "- Both apply() and map() are used to apply functions to data in Pandas, but they work on different data structures and have distinct use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.  What are some advanced features of NumPy?\n",
        "-NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. Beyond basic array operations, it offers advanced features that improve efficiency, performance, and flexibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. How does Pandas simplify time series analysis?\n",
        "- Pandas provides powerful tools for time series analysis, making it easy to work with date-time data, resampling, shifting, and rolling statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the role of a pivot table in Pandas?\n",
        "-A pivot table in Pandas is used to summarize, aggregate, and reorganize data in a flexible way. It helps in analyzing large datasets by rearranging rows and columns, similar to Excel's pivot table.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. Why is NumPy’s array slicing faster than Python’s list slicing?\n",
        "-NumPy’s array slicing is significantly faster than Python’s list slicing due to the following reasons.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What are some common use cases for Seaborn?\n",
